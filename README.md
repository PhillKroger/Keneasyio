# Keneasy.io | Site for filtering clothes and creating sets

``Project relevance``

```
Nowadays, the problem of finding clothes is not something difficult.
It is much more difficult to find what suits you personally.
And it is not always convenient to run from one page to another to select everything separately.
Therefore, we decided to create a website that can simplify the choice and show everything you need in sets.
```
Create a simple filter site to search for clothes by parameters. An analogue of an online store, only without unnecessary functionality and assortment.

1) Learn the Python programming language and its Django framework.
2) Implement a simple user-friendly interface.
3) Add functionality
4) Make the project public

``Description``

```
Now I’ll tell you a little about the interface of my mini-project.
The first photo is the main page. She acts as the cover of the project.
Header - top of the page with possible links. We have 5 of them.
1) Home - go to the main page
2) About - a link to a page with a brief description of the project
3) Filter - page with the main functionality of the project.
4) Profile - link to user profile
5) Logout / Sign in / Sign up - logout / login / registration
```
