Introduction
The modern world provides a huge variety of different products, goods and services. This is especially noticeable when we go to shopping centers or online stores. Every year, the number of different stores and brands is expanding in almost all areas, and clothing and footwear are no exception.
In the rhythm of modern society, many people practically do not have time to visit clothing stores and select an image. Fortunately, online shopping is very developed today. Wildberries, lamoda, online stores of individual brands, stores in social networks and much more give us a huge choice. Finding the right image can take a very long time due to the enormous variety. Finding a T-shirt or sweater that matches sneakers is not an easy task for everyone. But you still want to dress uniquely and stylishly. In this regard, we decided to create a site where clothing stores will create their own sets and share them with users who will be able to purchase clothes immediately on the site.


The purpose and objectives of the project
Purpose: to create a website that will provide functionality for filtering sets and searching for clothes by parameters.
Tasks:
⦁ Learn the Python programming language and its Django framework.
⦁ Implement simple interface, user-friendly.
⦁ Add functionality
⦁ Make the project public


Hypothesis
Finding the right look can take a very long time due to the huge variety of clothes and shoes. It is getting more and more difficult to make a choice, but you still want to dress uniquely and stylishly. Ready-made sets with various filtering by clothing selection parameters simplify the search problem and save a lot of time.

⦁ User profile (Fig. 2.).
  On the user profile page, his nickname and mail are shown at the top (the username is also indicated in the site header). Below is a link to a page to create a post. At the very bottom, all notes-posts of the user are shown.
Next, the user's cart, comments and likes will be implemented

⦁ Page with all products (Fig. 3.).
This page with all the products on the site, which can be filtered by three parameters: season, size, price. You can set only 3 optional search parameters
The product card is very simple. It contains basic information about the product.

⦁ A page displaying all the sets on the site.
Not only users, but also shops will be registered on the site. This page displays all sets of all stores in order. Further comments and likes will be attached to the sets to promote the best sets. All images show template pictures of clothes (Fig. 4.). This was done for convenience.

Nowadays, the problem of finding clothes is not something difficult.
It is much more difficult to find what suits you personally.
And it is not always convenient to run from one page to another to select everything separately.
Therefore, we decided to create a website that can simplify the choice and show everything you need in sets.
```
Create a simple filter site to search for clothes by parameters. An analogue of an online store, only without unnecessary functionality and assortment.
