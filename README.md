`Introduction`


```
The modern world provides a huge variety of different products, goods and services.
This is especially noticeable when we go to shopping centers or online stores.
Every year, the number of different stores and brands is expanding in almost all areas,
and clothing and footwear are no exception.
In the rhythm of modern society, many people practically do not have time to visit clothing stores and select an image.
Fortunately, online shopping is very developed today. Wildberries, lamoda, online stores of individual brands,
stores in social networks and much more give us a huge choice.
Finding the right image can take a very long time due to the enormous variety.
Finding a T-shirt or sweater that matches sneakers is not an easy task for everyone.
But you still want to dress uniquely and stylishly. In this regard,
we decided to create a site where clothing stores will create their
own sets and share them with users who will be able to purchase clothes immediately on the site.

```

User profile (Fig. 2.)
  On the user profile page, his nickname and mail are shown at the top
  (the username is also indicated in the site header). Below is a link to a page to create a post.
  At the very bottom, all notes-posts of the user are shown.

```
A page displaying all the sets on the site.
Not only users, but also shops will be registered on the site. This page
displays all sets of all stores in order. Further comments and likes will
be attached to the sets to promote the best sets.
All images show template pictures of clothes (Fig. 4.). This was done for convenience.
